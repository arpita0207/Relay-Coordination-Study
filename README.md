# Relay Coordination Study and Arc Flash Study
This was the project I was assigned during my two month summer internship at Vedanta Limited.

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and revising the relay coordination scheme for a power distribution system, along with performing an Arc Flash Study. The goal is to ensure selective coordination, minimize unnecessary trips, and establish safe working boundaries for operating personnel.  

The study was carried out on the **132kV switchyard, Main Control Room (MCR), Central Distribution Substation (CDSS), Solar Power Plant, and Steam Turbine Generator (STG)**.

##  Key Objectives  
- Study existing relay settings and tripping patterns.  
- Identify mis-coordination or unnecessary tripping.  
- Revise relay settings where required to improve **sensitivity, selectivity, and reliability**.  
- Perform Arc Flash Study to estimate **incident energy levels** and define **safe working distances**.

##  Project Workflow  
1. **System Study**  
   - Analyzed SLDs of 132kV switchyard, MCR, Solar Plant, CDSS, and STG.  
   - Developed a **Power Flow Chart SLD** from 132kV incomer to MCC level.  

2. **Data Collection**  
   - Relay data from **CDSS 11kV & 3.3kV HT breakers, PCCs, and MCCs**.  
   - Relay data from **Solar Power Plant**.  
   - Relay incomer data from **Control Room buses (Andrew Yule, Siemens, Jyoti panels)**.  

3. **Analysis**  
   - Studied **trip patterns** of Solar Plant and CDSS feeders.  
   - Compared tripping sequence against expected coordination.  
   - Incorporated insights from mentors and reference material on relay coordination.  

4. **Arc Flash Study**  
   - Carried out using **Excel-based calculations** due to unavailability of ETAP license.  
   - Input data obtained from **SparrowRMS Arc Flash Study Report**.  
   - Estimated **incident energy** and **arc flash boundaries**.

##  Tools & References:  
- **Microsoft Excel** (for Arc Flash calculations)  
- **Relay Manuals & OEM Documentation**  
- **SparrowRMS Arc Flash Study Report**  
- Technical papers and online resources on **relay coordination & arc flash**  

---

##  Deliverables:  
- Revised relay setting recommendations.  
- Power flow chart (SLD) up to MCC level.  
- Arc Flash study (Excel-based) with energy levels and safe distance estimations.  
- Analysis of existing trip patterns and proposed improvements.  

---

##  Notes: 
- ETAP software was not available; hence, Excel was used for Arc Flash Study.  
- The project was carried out with guidance from mentors and by referring to industrial study reports.
